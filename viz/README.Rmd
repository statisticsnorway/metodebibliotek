# Metodebibliotek ![Code Library](viz/codelibrary_ssb.png)
#### Statistics Norway's library for methods' code (dev version)
This list contains the names of methodological functions which may be useful in creating official statistics. All functions are open source in either R or python, although some call other programs in the background (eg JDemtra). ** This package is currently under development and is not intended for production purposes yet **

For technical help on the methods library and calling functions, see the [technical help file](viz/technical.md).

### Catalogue
Below is a list of functions in Statistic Norway's Metodebibliotek. It contains a short description of each function with a link to further documentation. If you want the list in table format [click here](viz/metodebib_tabell.md)


#### **Design**
This phase describes the development and design activities, and any associated practical research work needed to define the statistical outputs, concepts, methodologies, collection instruments and operational processes. 

```{r, echo = F, results="asis"}
source("../R/Input_form.R")
ssblist <- read.csv('./SSBfuncs.csv')
create_text(ssblist, tag = c("2.1", "2.2", "2.3", "2.4", "2.5", "2.6"))

```


#### **Collect**
This phase collects or gathers all necessary information (e.g. data, metadata and paradata), using different collection modes (e.g. acquisition, collection, extraction, transfer), and loads them into the appropriate environment for further processing.

```{r, echo = F, results="asis"}
create_text(ssblist, tag = c("4.1", "4.2", "4.3", "4.4"))
```


#### **Process**
This phase describes the processing of input data and their preparation for analysis.

```{r, echo = F, results="asis"}
create_text(ssblist, tag = c("5.1", "5.2", "5.3", "5.4", "5.5", "5.6", "5.7", "5.8"))
```


#### **Analyse**
In this phase, statistical outputs are produced and examined in detail. It includes preparing statistical content (including commentary, technical notes, etc.), and ensuring outputs are “fit for purpose” prior to dissemination to users.  


#### **Disseminate**
This phase manages the release of the statistical products to users. It includes all activities associated with assembling and releasing a range of static and dynamic products via a range of channels.  

```{r, echo = F, results="asis"}
create_text(ssblist, tag = c("7.1", "7.2", "7.3", "7.4", "7.5"))
```
